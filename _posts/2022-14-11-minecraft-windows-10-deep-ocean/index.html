                        <h1>Fix the Minecraft Launcher on a debloated Windows 10 install. (14.11.2022)</h1>
                    </div>
                
                <h1>Microsoft</h1>
<p>On February 8, 2022 I received an email from Mojang stating that I need to migrate my Account to a Microsoft one.</p>
<p>After another two emails, I finally migrated my Account in October.</p>
<p>But I haven't played the Game since sometime in 2021, so I tried to give it another shot today.</p>
<h1>Deep Ocean</h1>
<p>I downloaded the launcher from <a href="https://minecraft.net/">https://minecraft.net/</a> and installed it. After that I tried to log in with my Microsoft Account, but every time I clicked on the button an error popped up stating that there was some type of error with the error code being <code>deep ocean</code>.</p>
<p>So I did the first thing that came to my mind: clicking the info link in the error message. That turned out to be a <code>404</code>.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was disabling Pi-Hole for 30 seconds and flushing the DNS cache, it was possible that I was blocking some domains that Microsoft needs for their services. But this has not worked.</p>
<h1>YouTube tutorials</h1>
<p>After that, I searched &quot;Minecraft Windows 10 deep ocean error&quot;. There were a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmBJaZzQZco">recent videos</a> that showed the same steps: to enable some Xbox Services. After trying to reset the Microsoft Store and Minecraft Launcher, I noticed that there could be a problem with the Xbox stuff because I used a debloat script on my Windows installation.</p>
<h1>XBOX</h1>
<p>In the Windows 10 settings is a category called &quot;Gaming&quot; and a point called &quot;Xbox-Network&quot;. In there is a status for the Xbox-Network e.g. Internet Connectivity, Xbox Live-Services and Xbox Live-Multiplayer.
Under the point Xbox Live-Multiplayer is the status for Server connectivity, but for me that was disconnected/unavailable.</p>
<p><img src="./xbox-settings.webp" alt="Xbox Settings"></p>
<p>So I went to the Microsoft Store and searched for &quot;Xbox&quot; and there it was: the Xbox App got uninstalled by the Debloat script.</p>
<h1>Fix</h1>
<p>I installed the Xbox App, logged in, installed some missing components and started the Minecraft Launcher, but it was still not working. I was in a loop of having a Game license and playing the Demo.</p>
<p>So I logged out from the Microsoft Store, the Minecraft Launcher and the Xbox App.
After logging in again, everything was working.</p>
<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<ul>
<li>debloat script uninstalled the Xbox stuff from Windows 10</li>
<li>reinstall the Xbox App and the missing components</li>
<li>restart the PC</li>
<li>log out of the Microsoft Store, the Minecraft Launcher and the Xbox App</li>
<li>log back in</li>
<li>enjoy the Game</li>
</ul>
