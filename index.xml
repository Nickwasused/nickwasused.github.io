The PS4 is on firmware Version 9.0 where the CMOS Time Bomb was fixed. I mean it was fixed but e.g. Grand Theft Auto V (Version 1.38) with the No Intro were not able to start correctly (stuck at 90% Loading and heavy flickering).
The Fix The fix is very simple, but a little scary to do on a Jailbroken PS4.</description></item><item><title>How to install 32-bit BOINC on my 64-bit Raspberry Pi?</title><link>https://nickwasused.com/posts/2022-03-16-boinc-32bit-on-64bit-pi-dietpi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://nickwasused.com/posts/2022-03-16-boinc-32bit-on-64bit-pi-dietpi/</guid><description>Why would you do this? Projects like UNIVERSE@HOME have no aarch64 Tasks. A Raspberry Pi 3b canÂ´t run ROSETTA@HOME because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough ram. DietPi, a popular OS for the raspberry pi, uses 64Bit. Requirements 64-bit raspberry pi e.g. DietPi Type:
uname -a the output should contain the following: aarch64 if there is armhf in the output then you can skip to the Install section. Example output: Linux raspberrypi-1 5.</description></item><item><title>How do I block all the Twitter advertisers I've seen?</title><link>https://nickwasused.com/posts/2022-03-15-twitter-block-advertisers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 17:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://nickwasused.com/posts/2022-03-15-twitter-block-advertisers/</guid><description>Requirements For following this Guide you need the following:

(If you donÂ´t want to read all of this in short it means that the Router should have enough power to run current OpenWrt versions.)

Install GO Automatic Open the diet pi software installer by typing: dietpi-software.
