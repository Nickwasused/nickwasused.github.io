[{"categories":"PS4 jailbreak exploit firmware 900 9.0 CMOS time","contents":"The Problem After I replaced the CMOS Battery on my Base Model PS4, I noticed that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep the time after a power loss. The PS4 is on firmware Version 9.0 where the CMOS Time Bomb was fixed. I mean it was fixed but e.g. Grand Theft Auto V (Version 1.38) with the No Intro were not able to start correctly (stuck at 90% Loading and heavy flickering).\nThe Fix The fix is very simple, but a little scary to do on a Jailbroken PS4. You need to sync the time with a PSN Time Server. This has to be done once, after that the time will stay saved even after a power loss.\nMake sure to do at least one of the following steps before:\nHave a Pi-hole setup on your Network and whitelist the following Domain for: csla.np.community.playstation.net Have a payload that Blocks the Update Steps Set up the Pi-hole to block every domain for the PS4 (You can use the Groups feature for that.) Use a Payload that Blocks the Update process on the PS4 Connect to the Internet (preferable a LAN Cable, because you can unplug that quickly.) Go to the Settings and sync the Time using \u0026ldquo;Network Time\u0026rdquo; Disconnect from the Internet After you have done that, the PS4 should keep the correct time again.\n","permalink":"https://nickwasused.com/posts/2022-03-27-ps4-time-wrong-after-cmos-change-900/","tags":null,"title":"How to fix the PS4 Time after replacing the CMOS Battery on Firmware version 9.0?"},{"categories":"raspberry-pi BOINC 32-bit 64-bit aarch64 armhf","contents":"Why would you do this?
