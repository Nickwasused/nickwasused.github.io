You need to sync the time with a PSN Time Server. This has to be done once, after that the time will stay saved even after a power loss.\nMake sure to do at least one of the following steps before:\n Have a Pi-hole setup on your Network and whitelist the following Domain for: csla.np.community.playstation.net Have a payload that Blocks the Update  Steps  Set up the Pi-hole to block every domain for the PS4 (You can use the Groups feature for that.) Use a Payload that Blocks the Update process on the PS4 Connect to the Internet (preferable a LAN Cable, because you can unplug that quickly.) Go to the Settings and sync the Time using \u0026ldquo;Network Time\u0026rdquo; Disconnect from the Internet  After you have done that, the PS4 should keep the correct time again.\n","permalink":"https://nickwasused.com/posts/2022-03-27-ps4-time-wrong-after-cmos-change-900/","summary":"The Problem After I replaced the CMOS Battery on my Base Model PS4, I noticed that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep the time after a power loss.
