## Why would you do this?

- Projects like UNIVERSE@HOME have no aarch64 Tasks.
- A Raspberry Pi 3b canÂ´t run ROSETTA@HOME because it doesn't have enough ram.
- DietPi, a popular OS for the Raspberry Pi, uses 64Bit.

## Requirements

- 64-bit Raspberry Pi e.g. DietPi

Type:

```Shell
uname -a
``` 
the output should contain the following: ```aarch64``` if there is ```armhf``` in the output then you can skip to the 
[Install]({{< ref "#install-32-bit-boinc" >}} "Install") section.
Example output: ```Linux raspberrypi-1 5.10.103-v8+ #1530 SMP PREEMPT Tue Mar 8 13:06:35 GMT 2022 aarch64 GNU/Linux```

## Architecture

First, we need to add the 32-bit Architecture to our system with the following command:

```Shell
sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
```

Now you need to update the package list:

```Shell
sudo apt update
```


## Remove 64-bit Boinc

To remove the 64-bit version of the Boinc-Client type:

```Shell
sudo apt remove boinc-client -y
```

## Install 32-bit Boinc

If the output of ```uname -a``` is ```armhf``` then type:

```Shell
sudo apt install boinc-client
```

To install the 32-bit version of the Boinc-Client type:

```Shell
sudo apt install boinc-client:armhf -y
```
