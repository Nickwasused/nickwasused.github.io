Four Seasons is a fan created [Avatar: the last Airbender](https://www.nickanimation.com/content/avatar-the-last-air-bender/) Game. It is created by a [small team](https://trello.com/c/23WcABmc/231-credits), but it got started by [Elca Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2j48hm8b2ityC39SqhDKQg).

## Facts

The facts below are taken from the Four Seasons Press kit.

- The Game follows the plot of [Avatar: the last Airbender](https://www.nickanimation.com/content/avatar-the-last-air-bender/)
- [Aang](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Aang) and [Momo](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Momo) are playable characters
- The Game will have RPG elements like leveling and an item system with its own currency (coins)
- It is semi open world with large levels, e.g. [Ba Sing Se](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Ba_Sing_Se)
- You can revisit levels and use your newly acquired skills/abilities to find new paths/locations.
- Like mentioned above, you can revisit locations at any time after you visited them for the first time
- The world map (With that I really mean the Map, e.g. in GTA when you press ESC.) is fully created in 3D and can be explored with [Appa](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Appa).

The Game got its own soundtrack created by [CJ Music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Rrkbe9j6ayIe6ylQAfLzA). It is based on the original Music used in the Show.

But you can listen to it yourself, e.g. here is the White Lotus Raid:
